This project is a VR-based motion tracking system designed for experiments involving human motion data collection. The application is built using Unity and the XR Interaction Toolkit and is compatible with the Meta Quest 3 headset.  

## Features
- **Motion Data Recording**  
  Tracks the position and rotation of the VR headset and left and right hand controllers.  
- **Data Export**  
  Exports motion data in CSV format for post-experiment analysis.  
- **3D Motion Visualization**  
  Provides visualizations of recorded motion data as 3D videos.  
- **User Interaction**  
  Start and finish recording buttons are activated via hand-controller interactions.  

## Requirements
- Unity 2022 or newer 
- XR Interaction Toolkit  
- VR headset and controllers  
- [UXF (Unity Experiment Framework)](https://github.com/immersivecognition/unity-experiment-framework)
